# CMM007_ASSESSMENT (COURSEWORK OVERVIEW)


# PEER ASSESEMENT IN GROUP PROJECTS
In some modules, you are required to take part in a group project. In these instances, it is necessary for all group members to work together to complete a project. It is expected that all members will work with the same level of commitment and enthusiasm. However, this does not always occur and as such, peer assessment of individuals within group tasks is an important aspect. There is an opportunity for a web application to be created that could support this process. In this system, there are the following types of users:

	• Administrators
	• Students

Accompanying this, the following basic functionality should be implemented.

	• Administrators should login to the system to gain access.
	
	• Administrators should be able to set up a coursework item and then should be 
	  able to split students into groups for the coursework.
	
	• Students should enter the system through a personalized link and can then give feedback 
	  on how they worked in a group.
		o Students should be able to upload files to supplement their feedback.
		o Students should not see the feedback from other students.
		
	• Administrators should be able to see a detailed report for each group showing
	  how students worked together.


# WEBSITE IMPLEMENTATION
Using the information in the coursework overview document and the previous submission you now need to
develop your web application.

	• Create the client side code required to capture required data and display information to users.
	
	• Build the server side code to process data received and generate the required pages from the
	  backend database.
	
	• Ensure the functionality of the site is as listed in the requirements.
	
	• Create and execute a test plan to ensure your site functions as desired.
	
# ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY
You are encouraged to include additional functionality beyond the core functions described in the site
overview document.

# WEB APPLICATION CONSTRAINTS
The constraints listed below are not optional.

	• All code must be available on GitHub. It is advised that you use a private repository.
	
	• You are encouraged to use third party software libraries in your web application, however these must all be
	  referenced (using comments) inside of your web application and noted in your report.

# WHAT TO SUBMIT
You should submit:

i) a single PDF report containing the following information:

	• A brief description of your application, its design, architecture and any existing code libraries used
		o Include a diagram of the database design
	• Brief statement of compliance stating:
		o Requirements which have been implemented
		o any requirements have not been implemented
	• Test plan and test results completed for the full application
		o individual test cases should identify
			• the purpose of the test
			• the expected output
			• the actual output
	• The URL to your web application (optional)
	• The link to your GitHub Repository
	• Any usernames and passwords needed to test the application
	
ii) a short (less than 3 minutes) video, demonstrating the functionality of your application.
